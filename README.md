# TotemMCTools

In this repository, I plan to design a program used for several minecraft utilities.

The first utility I made, and the only one I was initially planning to make is the Skin to Totem program. This utility gets a Minecraft skin file and reads it to then create a totem-like texture with features from your skin. This then gets turned into a resource pack for the selected edition of the game. Unfortunately, you can only choose a custom item name for Bedrock Edition resource packs, but if that gets added to the Java Edition of the game, I'll make sure to add it as soon as I notice.

I'm also planning to make more utilities and tools in the future.

Something I also thought might be a good idea is a tool that allows you to preview banner designs. The idea is that you choose your banner patterns in the order you want, and then you can preview it without having to waste time by doing the same from a creative world.

I got inspired to make this by a lot of tools that already exist, and also by the skin totem fad. I want to unify all those useful tools into just one program.
